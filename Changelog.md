# 0.0.4
Correction for javascript error undefined jsonResponse

# 0.0.3

- Added feature to specify type of response to be sent from the controllers action. This will help digup to append appropriate template. It can be used when 'script' request(i.e accepts in request header text/javascript, application/javascript) is  made to the server and server returns html instead of javascript.
- Solved bugs in case when json was returned from the server

# 0.0.2

Initial working release
